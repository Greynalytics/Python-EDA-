# Exploratory Data Analysis on Supermarket Sales Data Set with Python 

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed on the Supermarket dataset from Kaggle, which included univariate, bivariate, and multivariate tests.
### The Primary goal of this project is to learn more about how to use some of the most powerful libraries for Data Science in Python (Pandas, Numpy, seaborne, and matplotlib) for data wrangling.
### To do this, we used our dataset to analyse and visualize the following Insight

### • What is the Aggregate Sales Among the Three Branches (A, B & C)? Branch A
### • Most Popular Payment Method Used by Customers? Ewallet
### • Distribution of Various Customer Rating - The Distribution of customer follow the Guassian distribution
### • Distribution of the Cost of Goods Sold? From the distribution curve below, the data is skewed to the right which gives us positve value using the pandas skew method.
### • Is there a relationship between Cost of Goods Sold and customer Ratings? The scatterplot reflects no relationship between cost of goods sold and customer rating.
### • Is there a relationship between Gross Income and Customers Rating? The scatterplot reflects no relationship between Gross Income and customer rating.
### • Establish the Product line that generates the Most Income? Home and lifestyle
### • Product line with the Highest Unit price? Sports and Travels
### • What are different payment methods used by Customers City wise ? E wallet is the most used payment method in the 3 cities as visualized in the heatmap
### • Ascertain the Highest quantity of product Line Purchased? Electronic Accessories
